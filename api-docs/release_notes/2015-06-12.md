# Show Appointment (GET /appointments/:id)
## Response Payload changes

- **preferred\_confirmation\_method**: An Appointment can now show a preferred\_confirmation\_method of **"none"**. This means that the Patient does not wish to be contacted at all. No attempts to confirm these Appointments should be made.

### Affected Fields

- start\_time
- end\_time
- created\_at
- updated\_at

<br/>

# Cancel Appointment (GET /appointments/:id/cancel)
## Response changes

Some Appointments cannot be cancelled due to their status. For these cases, improvements have been made:

- The response code is now 422 instead of 500
- The response payload includes a more detailed error message, including which status on the Appointment is causing the cancellation to fail

<br/>

# Inactive Records
The API now only returns records with a status of "Active" for the following API resources:

- Visit Reasons
- Appointment Resources
- Providers

<br/>
Endpoints that "List" these resources no longer include inactive records. Attempts to "Show" an inactive resource by its ID returns 404.

<br/>

# Records Created Through The API
Previously, only Appointments created through the API were labelled in our system as having been created by that particular third party Application. We are now also labelling:

- Appointment Confirmations
- Patients

<br/>

# Document Uploads
## Increased the maximum file size restriction

- The max file size restriction has been increased to 5MB.  The previous limit was 1MB.  An HTTP 413 error code will be returned when a file greater than 5MB is attempted to be uploaded.

<br/>

# ICD-10 Support

For endpoints whose request payloads contain diagnosis codes, a field called 'icd\_indicator' may now be included with an integer value of 9 or 10. If no ICD version is specified, it will default to ICD-9. If you are passing in an ICD-10 code, you must specify "icd\_indicator": 10 in the request body. The following endpoints are affected:

- /v1/patients/clinical/fullimport/:patient\_id/create
- /v1/patients/:patient\_id/problems/create
- /v1/charge/:patient\_id/create
