      <i>null</i>, 'phone', 'email', 'text_message', 'fax', 'other', 'none'

        - A preferred_confirmation_method of <i>null</i> means there is no preference with regard to communication method.
        - A preferred_confirmation_method of <i>'none'</i> means the Patient does not wish to be contacted at all.

For Appointments showing a preferred_confirmation_method of 'none', the Patient does not wish to be contacted at all, and no confirmation attempts should be made.
